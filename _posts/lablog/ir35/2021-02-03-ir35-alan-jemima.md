# IR35: HMRC examples - Alan and Jemima

**Please note: this article does not provide legal advice.**

This article is part of a suite - a whirlwind tour to get up to speed on IR35:

<div class="box">
<p><b>HMRC's thinking revealed</b></p>
<p>HMRC's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ir35-business-entity-tests">twelve business entity tests</a> were withdrawn in 2015, but unlike the Alan and Jemima example below <b>explain HMRC's thinking.</b> These more realistic examples are worth reading.</p>

## Alan and Jemima

There are few HMRC examples. Here's one.

**Alan is clearly not employed.**
- He is is business on his own account - other clients, own equipment.
- He bears financial risk especially time-wise and perhaps quality.

A day contract might also entail financial risk. A hirer could terminate the contract - or let it end naturally - then say the work or end product was not of high enough quality.

Another example would be a decorator. Many work on on day rates, but would (in theory) have to put right poor work. The same might apply to light building and maintenance work.

**Jemima is probably employed.**
- Even though she could work for others.
- There is no indication that she bears financial risk.

Jemima could work for others, but the pointers are to employment in this position:

- specified hours
- hirer provides equipment (this **could** be for security reasons)
- reporting line (probably formal reporting rather than administration)
- paid overtime (this is very problematic)

I would expect that Jemima also has other employment rights e.g. holiday and pension. 

Needing permission to work from home suggests an uncomfortable degree of control.

Having to follow a style guide is not so problematic; the reality is that Alan will also be under software and brand-related restrictions.

<div class="box">
<p><b>My conclusion</b></p>

The key things at play here are having:

<ol>
    <li>more expertise than your boss(!)</li>
    <li>the ability to work for other clients</li>
    <li>at least some freedom in working practices</li>
</ol>

<p>HMRC may picture Jemima as having little expertise in (1) and being very constrained by (3).</p>
