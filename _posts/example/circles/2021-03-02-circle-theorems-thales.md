# Circle theorems: Thales

{% include nav_circles.html %}

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales%27s_theorem">Thales's theorem</a> is that the angle made between points A and B on the ends of a circle <b>diameter</b> and a third point P on the circle circumference is 90&deg;.</p>

## Thales interactive

In the diagram below you can move point P on the circumference.

<div id="geogebra" class="displayed"></div>

You can see that &ang;APB is always 90&deg;.

## Thales: the proof

We first draw a line from O to P.

Now consider &Delta;OAP:

- \|OP\| = \|OA\| as both are radii.
- So &Delta;OAP is isosceles.
- Set the two identical angles to &alpha;.

Similarly &Delta;OBP is isosceles. Set its identical angles to &beta;.

Sum &Delta;APB angles: 180&deg; = &alpha; + (&alpha; + &beta;) + &beta; which simplifies to &alpha; + &beta; &ang;APB = 90&deg;. &#8718;

## Where to now?

What if the chord AB is not a diameter? It turns out that &ang;APB is still constant.
