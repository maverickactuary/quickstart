# MY NEW SERIES - part 2

### A suite of new articles

{% include nav_newseries.html %}

This article examines volumes and market shares for the term market (life cover and critical illness cover) for the years 2000-2020, paying particular attention to the movements in 2020.

<p class="highlight">At the outset I would like to acknowledge and thank Ron Wheatcroft of Swiss Re for fielding a number of data queries. Any errors made and views expressed in this post are my own.</p>

## Sales and market share of the top 5

Market volume and top 5 share:

**Source:** TermWatch 2001-2021

Key features:

+ The term market peaked in 2003.
+ Policy sales have been largely static over the last c15 years.
+ The top 5 market share rose sharply over 2009-2011...
+ ... but has declined a little since.

## Splitting the top 5

We now include 5 new lines, showing the market share for each of positions 1-5:

**Source:** TermWatch 2001-2021

Market shares for positions 2-4 almost converged in 2020, illustrated by their overlapping labels. The numbers behind the graph showed the biggest lead of 1st over 2nd position was in 2015 (20.6%) followed by 2020 (19.5%). The 4th-5th gap is also at a record high.

## Gaps in the top 5

Let's look at those gaps before 2020:

![Gaps in the protection market](/assets/img/20002020-market-top5-gaps.png "Gaps in the protection market")
**Source:** TermWatch 2001-2021

In 2020:

+ The gap from 1st (L&G) to 2nd (Royal London) is almost at a record high.
+ Similar the gap from 4th (AIG) to 5th (Zurich) is at a record high.
+ But between there is bunching: the gap from 2nd to 4th is at a record low.

## Sales and market shares for 2020

The numbers behind the 2020 part of the graphs are as follows:

| # | Company             | Policies | Market share |
|:--|:--------------------|---------:| -----------: |
| 1 | Legal &amp; General |  504,061 |        31.7% |
| 2 | Royal London        |  194,785 |        12.3% |
| 3 | Aviva               |  182,931 |        11.5% |
| 4 | AIG                 |  182,013 |        11.5% |
| 5 | Zurich              |  101,946 |         6.4% |

**Source:** TermWatch 2021

Over 2000-2020 the top position was taken by either Aviva (3 times from 2000-2002) or L&amp;G (18 times from 2003-2020). That won't change soon. Why is L&amp;G **so** successful?

The real tension is in positions 2-4: in 2020 Aviva, having fallen to 3rd for the first time, was less than 1000 policies ahead of AIG. What happens next?

## The 2020 top 5: market shares 2017-2020

For 2017-2020, inclusive, the top 5 positions have been taken by the same insurers. L&amp;G has always been top, Zurich always 5th, with a little movement in 2-4.

Over 2017-2020 the top 5's share reduced from 77.7% to 73.4%. In that context:

+ Aviva's share has declined, almost halving over the period.
+ AIG grew strongly in the first two years, but has stabilized.
+ Royal London's share was slowly declining, but saw a big rise in 2020.
+ Zurich has been stable throughout.
+ L&amp;G's share had declined slightly from a high base, but went back up in 2020.

## Where next?

My aspiration is to extend this post, giving:

+ Separate coverage of critical illness, income protection and whole of life.
+ Views on previously influential protection insurers e.g. Scottish Provident and Bright Grey.
+ Speculation for the period 2021-2030.

I've always had a talent for intentions!
